								<strong>Grace Brewster Murray Hopper</strong> (December 9, 1906 – January 1, 1992), née
								<strong>Grace Brewster Murray</strong>, was an American computer scientist and United
								States Navy Rear Admiral. She was one of the first programmers of the
								<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Mark_I">Harvard Mark I</a> computer in 1944,
								invented the first compiler for a computer programming language, and was one of those who
								popularized the idea of machine-independent programming languages which led to the development
								of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL">COBOL</a>, one of the first high-level programming
								languages. She is credited with popularizing the term "debugging" for fixing computer glitches
								(in one instance, removing a moth from a computer).
							</p>

							<p>
								Owing to her accomplishments and her naval rank, she is sometimes referred to as "Amazing Grace".
								The U.S. Navy Arleigh Burke class guided-missile destroyer USS Hopper (DDG-70) is named for her,
								as is the Cray XE6 "Hopper" supercomputer at NERSC.
